At first, von Frisch thought the bees were responding only to the scent of the food.
But what did the third dance mean? And if bees were responding only to the scent,
how could they also ‘sniff down’ food hundreds of metres away from the hive*, food
which was sometimes downwind? On a hunch, he started gradually moving the
feeding dish further and further away and noticed as he did so that the dances of the
returning scout bees also started changing. If he placed the feeding dish over nine
metres away, the second type of dance, the sickle version, came into play.
But once he moved it past 36 metres, the scouts would then start dancing the third,
quite different, waggle dance.
The measurement of the actual distance too, he concluded, was precise. For
example, a feeding dish 300 metres away was indicated by 15 complete runs
through the pattern in 30 seconds. When the dish was moved to 60 metres away,
the number dropped to eleven.
