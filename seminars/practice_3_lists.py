# Common information about lists

# lists are mutable
# lists are iterable

# Create a list
example = [1, 2, 3]

# List concatenation, the original list doesn't change
first_list = example + [2, 3, 4]

# List methods (some of them)
# .insert(index, item) -> inserts the given item on the mentioned index
# .remove(item) - removes the first occurrence of the given item from the list
# .pop() or .pop(index) – removes the item from the given index
# (or the last item) and returns that item
# .index(item) – returns the index of the first occurrence
# .sort() – sorts the list in place i.e modifies the original list
# .reverse() – reverses the list in place
# .copy() – returns a shallow copy of the list
