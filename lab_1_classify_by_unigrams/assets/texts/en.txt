Von Frisch noted something further. When the scout bees came home to tell their
sisters about the food source, sometimes they would dance outside on the horizontal
entrance platform of the hive, and sometimes on the vertical wall inside. And,
depending on where they danced, the straight portion of the waggle dance would
point in different directions. The outside dance was fairly easy to decode: the straight
portion of the dance pointed directly to the food source, so the bees would merely
have to decode the distance message and fly off in that direction to find their food.
But by studying the dance on the inner wall of the hive, von Frisch discovered a
remarkable method which the dancer used to tell her sisters the direction of the food
in relation to the sun. When inside the hive, the dancer cannot use the sun, so she
uses gravity instead. The direction of the sun is represented by the top of the hive
wall. If she runs straight up, this means that the feeding place is in the same
direction as the sun. However, if, for example, the feeding place is 40º to the left of
the sun, then the dancer would run 40º to the left of the vertical line. This was to be
the first of von Frisch’s remarkable discoveries. Soon he would also discover a
number of other remarkable facts about how bees communicate and, in doing so,
revolutionise the study of animal behaviour generally.
